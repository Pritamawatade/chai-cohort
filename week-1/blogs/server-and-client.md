# What is server and client, and how do both works?
## What is server?

Server is a keyword that is heard everywhere these days, but most people, even those in the tech field, don’t know what a server is.

i am not gonna give you the definition from the internet and tell you in the complex words. Be simple.
because a wise once said.

simplicity is better than complexity.

server is like a big computer that stores a big amount of data and whose work is to send and receive request from the client. The part of the definition where i said that stores the big amount of data that not completely true. because your small laptop can be a server. A server is nothing but a computer that sends and receive the data and stores it. We develop our server to store the data which we need to access and modify further.
so that is the whole story of what actually the server is.

Now let’s talk about what the client is?

A client is mostly the computer which sends the request to the server. Yes a client is nothing more than a computer that make requests for data or information to the server. And in most cases, a client is actually browser. On behalf of you every time you need a data to come from server(backend) a client makes the request to the backend(server) and then the server sends the data we needed to the client. then the client (browser) show this data to on the frontend(on web page)
and the whole story of the server and the client.

these are nothing but the fancy term for saying a communication between the two computers who sends and receive data from each other.
